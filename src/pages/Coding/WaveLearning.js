                    During the summer of 2020, I had so much fun exploring the graphical capabilities and data analysis tools in R/RShiny through another project that I volunteered to take on several teaching roles to share my skills in R with other students.
                    I became a coding assistant for S-152: Discrete Mathematics and volunteered for Wave Learning Festival,
                    in which I co-taught a 5-day seminar called "Data Analysis and Web Apps in RShiny", covering programming, statistics, data analysis/visualization tools in R, and web application development in RShiny for 30+ high-school students!
                    Here below are some lecture reocrdings of my class, shared through my other YouTube channel,
