                    In the fall semester of 2020, I took a class called "How Music Works: Engineering the Acoustical World", in which we applied concepts from mechnical and eletrical engineering to explore and create our own musical systems.
                    For my final project, I developed a web app called <a href="https://polysymph.herokuapp.com" target="_blank" style={{color: "green"}}>PolySymph</a> (a wordplay of Polyphonic Synthesizer + Symphony),
                    a music composition app that allows the user to experiment with the fundamental components of a band in a uniquely displayed format.

                    I first synthesized original sounds on the backend in Python by superpositioning sinewave signals according to fixed (and random!) sets of Fourier coefficients.

                <div>
                    I then mapped these sounds to the frontend of the app using the micro web framework Flask.
