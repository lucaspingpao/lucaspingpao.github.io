                    I am also enrolled in a special dual-degree program with the Berklee College of Music, where I intend to get a Masters in Music in Contemporary Performance and Produciton.
                    In high school I started recording videos of piano covers on my first YouTube Channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm0a7WR5C2684z6fL5XNodw">PaoPianoCovers</a>. 
                    Over the years, I have developed many videos, but here are some of my projects:

                <u><h2>100 Day Song Challenge</h2></u>
                <p>
                    This summer I recorded 100 songs (almost!) every day for 3 months straight. <br/>
                    Here below is a video of the final song I did, for which I made a special video production!

                <u><h2>Composition</h2></u>

                <p>
                    I also love composing music, which I have been doing since I was 5 years old.
                    (hopefully I'll be able to dig up some of my old compositions to showcase on my website soon!)
                    I originally started composing classical orchestral masterpieces but eventually transitioned into producing EDM beats.
                    Here below is one of my featured productions I created this summer!
