                    I also love composing music, which I have been doing since I was 5 years old.
                    (hopefully I'll be able to dig up some of my old compositions to showcase on my website soon!)
                    I originally started composing classical orchestral masterpieces but eventually transitioned into producing EDM beats.
                    Here below is one of my featured productions I created this summer!
