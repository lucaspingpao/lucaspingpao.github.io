# Lucas Pao's Full-Stack Development Portfolio

Welcome! My name is Lucas Pao and I am a recent graduate from Harvard with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. Below is a summary of my educational and professional experiences.

The first project I would like to highlight is my [Personal Portfolio Website](https://lucaspingpao.github.io/) which provides an interactive walk-through of the information you will find below. This website was developed with React (JavaScript), HTML, and CSS. It was also designed using exclusively native elements, i.e. no external CSS design libraries have been referenced (you can check the code in this repo to verify!) in order to showcase my *frontend web development* skills.

## Education

My journey into software development started with a theoretical foundation into Computer Science. Here is a list of CS courses I have taken:

* [AP Computer Science A](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a) (Java)
* [COMPSCI 50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/) (C, Python, SQL)
* [COMPSCI 51: Abstraction and Design for Computation](https://cs51.io/) (OCaml)
* [COMPSCI 61: Systems Programming and Machine Organization](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/) (C)
* [COMPSCI 79: Design of Useful and Usable Interactive Systems](https://glassmanlab.seas.harvard.edu/cs179.html) (Figma)
* [APMTH 120: Applied Linear Algebra & Big Data](https://web-static-aws.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/Courses/APM120/2021spring/detailed-syllabus-apm120.pdf) (Python)
* [COMPSCI 124: Data Structures and Algorithms](https://groups.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs124/cs124.html) (C++, Python)
* [COMPSCI 181: Machine Learning](https://harvard-ml-courses.github.io/cs181-web/) (Python)
