    As a hands-on visual learner, I was inspired to create educational visualization apps to help me and my peers grasp abstract mathematical concepts better.\n                    This summer, my former math professor Paul Bamberg helped mentor me in creating these visualization apps in RShiny. Here are some featured apps that you should check out:\n                </p>\n                \n                <p style={{paddingLeft: \"15%\", paddingRight: \"15%\", textAlign: \"left\"}}>\n                    <br/>1. <a href=\"https://lucaspingpao.shinyapps.io/Math23a-Week1-MarkovModels/\">Markov Models</a>: Calculates the number of paths between vertices on a finite directed graph using transition matrices.\n                    <br/>2. <a href=\"https://lucaspingpao.shinyapps.io/Math23a-Week3-RowReduction/\">Row Reduction</a>: Provides step-by-step instructions of the row reduction process and finds orthonormal basis of column vectors using the Gram-Schmidt method.\n                    <br/>3. <a href=\"https://lucaspingpao.shinyapps.io/Math23a-Week4-Eigenvectors/\">Eigenvectors</a>: Provides step-by-step instructions for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an inputted matrix using Axler's method.\n                    <br/>4. <a href=\"https://lucaspingpao.shinyapps.io/Math23-Week5-Sequences/\">Sequence Convergence</a>: Illustrates the formal epsilon definition of sequence convergence with animated graphs.\n                    <br/>5. <a href=\"https://lucaspingpao.shinyapps.io/Math23-Week9-FiniteTopology/\">Finite Topology</a>: Illustrates basic definitions of finite topology applied to directed graphs such as interior, closure, boundary, etc.\n                </p>\n\n                <iframe width=\"900\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://lucaspingpao.shinyapps.io/Math23-Week5-Sequences/\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n                \n                <hr/>\n                <u><h2>Wave Learning Festival Seminar: Data Analysis and Web Apps in RShiny</h2></u>\n                <p style={{paddingLeft: \"15%\", paddingRight: \"15%\"}}>\n                    I had so much fun exploring the graphical capabilities and data analysis tools in R/RShiny that I volunteered to take on several teaching roles to share my skills in R with other students.\n                    I became a coding assistant for S-152: Discrete Mathematics and volunteered for Wave Learning Festival,\n                    in which I co-taught a 5-day seminar called \"Data Analysis and Web Apps in RShiny\", covering programming, statistics, data analysis/visualization tools in R, and web application development in RShiny for 30+ high-school students!\n                    Here below are some lecture reocrdings of my class, shared through my other YouTube channel,\n                    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMta0o0GMm6zw6IFPf_Epgw\"> PaoCodingTutorials</a>.\n                </p>\n                <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLjT_SXeguj8BnrPFmkfAJnDY_9h9xCpWO\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n                \n                <hr/>\n                <u><h2>VotrCrowd: IvyHacks Hackathon</h2></u>\n                <p style={{paddingLeft: \"15%\", paddingRight: \"15%\"}}>\n                    Through my journey into the tech world, I have been constantly inspired by the ways in which we can utiilize technology to improve all aspects of our society, especially through emerging fields in EdTech, CivicTech, and general SocialGood Tech.\n                    The projects above are examples of ways I have dabbled into EdTech. One CivicTech project I pursued was at the first annual virtual hackathon called IvyHacks.\n                </p>\n                \n                <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5WL0OOjLrmU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>   \n            </div>\n            \n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default Coding;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
