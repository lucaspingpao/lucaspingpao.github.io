Mathematics concentrator, I spent my first year taking foundational courses in Linear Algebra and Real Analysis.\n                    While I found these classes fascinating and rewarding, transitioning into abstract thinking was quite a challenge.\n                    I saw many of peers around me with similar struggles as we worked through difficult proofs.\n                    As a hands-on visual learner, I was inspired to create educational visualization apps to help me and my peers grasp abstract mathematical concepts better.\n                    This summer, my former math professor Paul Bamberg helped mentor me in creating these visualization apps in RShiny.
